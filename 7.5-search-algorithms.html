  <h1>7.5 Search Algorithms</h1>
  <section>
    <h2>Objectives</h2>
    <p>
      To develop and write linear and binary search algorithms with guidance<br>
      To be able to describe the efficiency of an algorithm using "Big O" notation
    </p>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <h3>Search Algorithms</h3>
    <p>
      Algorithim steps 

      1. Get array and target values

      2. set a counter to i=0

      3. Ceck if the element at arr[i] is equal to the target value

      4. if elemnt mathes, return index (i). Otherwise, increment i by 1 and repeat step 3

      5. if the index is greater than the last index of the array, return -1 to indicate the target value was not found.
 
    </p>

    <h3>Linear Search Algorithm</h3>
    <p>
      Algorithim steps 

      1. Get array and target values

      2. set a counter to i=0

      3. Ceck if the element at arr[i] is equal to the target value

      4. if elemnt mathes, return index (i). Otherwise, increment i by 1 and repeat step 3

      5. if the index is greater than the last index of the array, return -1 to indicate the target value was not found.
    </p>

    <h3>Binary Search Algorithm</h3>
    <p>
      Sort the array in ascending order
Set the low index to 0 and high index to length – 1
Set the middle index to the average of the low and high indices
If the middle index is the target, return the middle index
If the target element is less than the element at the middle index, set the high index to the middle index – 1
If the target element is greater than the element at the middle index, set the low index to the middle index + 1
Repeat steps 3-6 until it is found, or the low and high index are equal in which case, the target is not in the array

    </p>
    O(n) means that that maximum number of steps it will take to find an element in an array is equal to the number of elements in the array
